Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C. Each day, I will solve a problem, optimize my approach, and improve my coding skills.

ðŸ“Œ Day 1: Arrays â€“ Reversing an Array

Problem Statement: Given an array A of size N, reverse the array in-place without using extra space.

ðŸ“Œ Day 2: Basic Data Type

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

ðŸ“Œ Day 3: 2D Array DS

Problem Statement:Given a 6 x 6 2D array,arr, an hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in the following pattern

ðŸ“Œ Day 4: Dyanmic Array Problem Statement:Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed. Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0

ðŸ“Œ Day 5: Left Rotation

Problem statement :A left rotation operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements unit to the left. The elements 1 that fall off the left end reappear at the right end. Given an integer d , rotate the array that many steps to the left and return the result.

ðŸ“Œ Day 6: String Similarity

Problem Statement: For two strings A and B, we define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings.

ðŸ“Œ Day 7: Digit Frequency

Problem Statement: Given a string, s, consisting of alphabets and digits, find the frequency of each digit in the given string.

ðŸ“Œ Day 8: Calculate the Nth term

Problem Statement: There is a series, S, where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series,a ,b ,c and  respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion.

ðŸ“Œ Day 9: Power Calculation

Problem Statement: Help Shashank in calculating the value of S, which is given as follows. Since the value of S can be very large, he only wants the last 2 digits of S.

ðŸ“Œ Day 10: Permuting Two Arrays

Problem Statement: There are two n-element arrays of integers A, B and .Permute them into some A' and B' such that the relation A'[i] + B'[i] >=k holds for all i where 0<=i<n.
There will be q queries consisting of A, B, k and . For each query, return YES if some permutation A', B' satisfying the relation exists. Otherwise, return NO.

ðŸ“Œ Day 11: Array Reversal

Problem Statement: Given an array, of size n, reverse it.

ðŸ“Œ Day 12: Students Marks Sum

Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, marks, denoting the marks scored by students in a class.
-> The alternating elements marks0, marks2, marks4 and so on denote the marks of boys.
-> Similarly, marks1, marks3, marks5 and so on denote the marks of girls.
The array name, marks, works as a pointer which stores the base address of that array. In other words, marks contains the address where marks0 is stored in the memory.

ðŸ“Œ Day 13: Bitwise Operators

Problem Statement: In this challenge, you will use logical bitwise operators. All data is stored in its binary representation. The logical operators, and C language, use 1 to represent true and 0 to represent false. The logical operators compare bits in two numbers and return true or false, 0 or 1, for each bit compared.

ðŸ“Œ Day 14: Array Manipulation

Problem Statement: Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

ðŸ“Œ Day 15: Mini-Max Sum

Problem Statement: Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

ðŸ“Œ Day 16: Time Conversion

Problem Statement: Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

ðŸ“Œ Day 17: Grading Students

Problem Statement: HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

ðŸ“Œ Day 18: Diagonal Difference

Problem Statement: Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

ðŸ“Œ Day 19: Plus Minus 

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negetive, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new 
line with 6 places after the decimal.
