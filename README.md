Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C. Each day, I will solve a problem, optimize my approach, and improve my coding skills.

📌 Day 1: Arrays – Reversing an Array

Problem Statement: Given an array A of size N, reverse the array in-place without using extra space.

📌 Day 2: Basic Data Type

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

📌 Day 3: 2D Array DS

Problem Statement:Given a 6 x 6 2D array,arr, an hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in the following pattern

📌 Day 4: Dyanmic Array Problem Statement:Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed. Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0

📌 Day 5: Left Rotation

Problem statement :A left rotation operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements unit to the left. The elements 1 that fall off the left end reappear at the right end. Given an integer d , rotate the array that many steps to the left and return the result.

📌 Day 6: String Similarity

Problem Statement: For two strings A and B, we define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings.

📌 Day 7: Digit Frequency

Problem Statement: Given a string, s, consisting of alphabets and digits, find the frequency of each digit in the given string.

📌 Day 8: Calculate the Nth term

Problem Statement: There is a series, S, where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series,a ,b ,c and  respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion.

📌 Day 9: Power Calculation

Problem Statement: Help Shashank in calculating the value of S, which is given as follows. Since the value of S can be very large, he only wants the last 2 digits of S.

📌 Day 10: Permuting Two Arrays

Problem Statement: There are two n-element arrays of integers A, B and .Permute them into some A' and B' such that the relation A'[i] + B'[i] >=k holds for all i where 0<=i<n.
There will be q queries consisting of A, B, k and . For each query, return YES if some permutation A', B' satisfying the relation exists. Otherwise, return NO.

📌 Day 11: Array Reversal

Problem Statement: Given an array, of size n, reverse it.
