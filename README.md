Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C. Each day, I will solve a problem,
optimize my approach, and improve my coding skills.

ðŸ“Œ Day 1: Arrays â€“ Reversing an Array

Problem Statement: Given an array A of size N, reverse the array in-place without using extra space.

ðŸ“Œ Day 2: Basic Data Type

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

ðŸ“Œ Day 3: 2D Array DS

Problem Statement:Given a 6 x 6 2D array,arr, an hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in the following pattern

ðŸ“Œ Day 4: Dyanmic Array Problem Statement:Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed. Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0

ðŸ“Œ Day 5: Left Rotation

Problem statement :A left rotation operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements unit to the left. The elements 1 that fall off the left end reappear at
the right end. Given an integer d , rotate the array that many steps to the left and return the result.

ðŸ“Œ Day 6: String Similarity

Problem Statement: For two strings A and B, we define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings.

ðŸ“Œ Day 7: Digit Frequency

Problem Statement: Given a string, s, consisting of alphabets and digits, find the frequency of each digit in the given string.

ðŸ“Œ Day 8: Calculate the Nth term

Problem Statement: There is a series, S, where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series,a ,b ,c and  respectively, you 
have to output the nth term of the series using recursion.

ðŸ“Œ Day 9: Power Calculation

Problem Statement: Help Shashank in calculating the value of S, which is given as follows. Since the value of S can be very large, he only wants the last 2 digits of S.

ðŸ“Œ Day 10: Permuting Two Arrays

Problem Statement: There are two n-element arrays of integers A, B and .Permute them into some A' and B' such that the relation A'[i] + B'[i] >=k holds for all i where
0<=i<n.
There will be q queries consisting of A, B, k and . For each query, return YES if some permutation A', B' satisfying the relation exists. Otherwise, return NO.

ðŸ“Œ Day 11: Array Reversal

Problem Statement: Given an array, of size n, reverse it.

ðŸ“Œ Day 12: Students Marks Sum

Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, marks, denoting the marks scored by students in a class.
-> The alternating elements marks0, marks2, marks4 and so on denote the marks of boys.
-> Similarly, marks1, marks3, marks5 and so on denote the marks of girls.
The array name, marks, works as a pointer which stores the base address of that array. In other words, marks contains the address where marks0 is stored in the memory.

ðŸ“Œ Day 13: Bitwise Operators

Problem Statement: In this challenge, you will use logical bitwise operators. All data is stored in its binary representation. The logical operators, and C language, use 1 
to represent true and 0 to represent false. The logical operators compare bits in two numbers and return true or false, 0 or 1, for each bit compared.

ðŸ“Œ Day 14: Array Manipulation

Problem Statement: Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each array element between two given indices,
inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

ðŸ“Œ Day 15: Mini-Max Sum

Problem Statement: Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the 
respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

ðŸ“Œ Day 16: Time Conversion

Problem Statement: Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

ðŸ“Œ Day 17: Grading Students

Problem Statement: HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

ðŸ“Œ Day 18: Diagonal Difference

Problem Statement: Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

ðŸ“Œ Day 19: Plus Minus 

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negetive, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new 
line with 6 places after the decimal.

ðŸ“Œ Day 20: Recursive Digit Sum 

Problem Statement: We define super digit of an integer x using the following rules:

Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer.

ðŸ“Œ Day 21: Solve Me First

Problem Statement: Complete the function solveMeFirst to compute the sum of two integers.

ðŸ“Œ Day 22: Cats and a Mouse

Problem Statement: Two cats and a mouse are at various positions on a line. You will be given their starting positions. Your task is to determine which cat will reach the 
mouse first, assuming the mouse does not move and the cats travel at equal speed. If the cats arrive at the same time, the mouse will be allowed to move and it will escape
while they fight.

ðŸ“Œ Day 23: Birthday Cake Candles

Problem Statement: You are in charge of the cake for a child's birthday. It will have one candle for each year of their total age. They will only be able to blow out the 
tallest of the candles. Your task is to count how many candles are the tallest.

ðŸ“Œ Day 24: Staircase

Problem Statement: Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.

ðŸ“Œ Day 25: Counting Valleys

Problem Statement: An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly steps steps, for every step it was noted if it was an 
uphill, U, or a downhill, D step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:

A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.

ðŸ“Œ Day 25: Electronics Shop

Problem Statement: A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USB drive that can be purchased with a give budget. Given price lists for keyboards
and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them. If it is not possible to buy both items, return -1.

ðŸ“Œ Day 25: Angry Professor

Problem Statement: A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, the professor decides to cancel class if fewer than 
some number of students are present when class starts. Arrival times go from on time (arrivalTime<=0) to arrived late (arrivalTime>0).

Given the arrival time of each student and a threshhold number of attendees, determine if the class is cancelled.

ðŸ“Œ Day 26: Circular Array Rotation

Problem Statement: John Watson knows of an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers. One rotation operation moves the last array element to the 
first position and shifts all remaining elements right one. To test Sherlock's abilities, Watson provides Sherlock with an array of integers. Sherlock is to perform the 
rotation operation a number of times then determine the value of the element at a given position.

For each array, perform a number of right circular rotations and return the values of the elements at the given indices.

ðŸ“Œ Day 27: Halloween Sale

Problem Statement: You wish to buy video games from the famous online video game store Mist.

Usually, all games are sold at the same price, p dollars. However, they are planning to have the seasonal Halloween Sale next month in which you can buy games at a cheaper
price. Specifically, the first game will cost p dollars, and every subsequent game will cost d dollars less than the previous one. This continues until the cost becomes less
than or equal to m dollars, after which every game will cost m dollars. How many games can you buy during the Halloween Sale?

ðŸ“Œ Day 28: Extra Long Factorials

Problem Statement: Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

ðŸ“Œ Day 29: Maximum Element

Problem Statement: You have an empty sequence, and you will be given N queries. Each query is one of these three types:

1 x  -Push the element x into the stack.
2    -Delete the element present at the top of the stack.
3    -Print the maximum element in the stack.

ðŸ“Œ Day 30: Simple Text Editor

Problem Statement: Implement a simple text editor. The editor initially contains an empty string, S. Perform Q operations of the following 4 types:
1. append(W)- Append string W to the end of S.
2. delete(k)- Delete the last k characters of S.
3. print(k)- Print the kth character of S.
4. undo()- Undo the last (not previously undone) operation of type 1 or 2, reverting S to the state it was in prior to that operation.

ðŸ“Œ Day 31: Equal Stacks

Problem Statement: You have three stacks of cylinders where each cylinder has the same diameter, but they may vary in height. You can change the height of a stack by 
removing and discarding its topmost cylinder any number of times.

Find the maximum possible height of the stacks such that all of the stacks are exactly the same height. This means you must remove zero or more cylinders from the top of 
zero or more of the three stacks until they are all the same height, then return the height.
